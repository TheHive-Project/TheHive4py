'''

Script that works with thehive4py and theHive's elasticsearch api to:
1. Obtain a list of all alert ids
2. Use these ids to permantely delete the alerts

Use at your own risk! This will delete ALL alerts

Note:In testing, no negative consequneces found on cases that orignated from alerts.
Your experience may vary.

 
Note 2: You may need to change the index queried in line 56. To determine your theHive index first run:
  curl -GET http://127.0.0.1:9200/_cat/indices?pretty
  
  Lines 37, 38 contain logic to narrow down to times less than or equal to a unix date stamp
